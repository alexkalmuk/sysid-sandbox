The problem is to construct robust control in
probabilistic sense for all possible values from some predefined
set. In that case it is a good way to shrink the set over time
in order to get better sets. The proposed algorithm is based
on the modified LSCR (Leave-out Sign-dominant Correlation
Regions) and applied to state space model used in MPC.
